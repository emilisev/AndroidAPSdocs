# List of tested Phones

Generic recommendations for choosing a phone suitable for **AAPS** can be found on the [Phones page](../Getting-Started/Phones.md).

## Feedback from other users

We maintain a list of the [tested hardware setups](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vScCNaIguEZVTVFAgpv1kXHdsHl3fs6xT6RB2Z1CeVJ561AvvqGwxMhlmSHk4J056gMCAQE02sAWJvT/pubhtml?gid=683363241&single=true). This list provides user feedback on the usage of a phone along with **AAPS** and a given pump and CGM. It can help you check if your phone / pump / CGM has been used successfully by other users.

The document is read-only. With CRTL-F, you can search in the text of the Google sheet.

To record your test of a hardware setup, please fill in this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfoGKLYEx4aUAJ5RWL3xLJeNdmRyxtXmDzpGhuU3Rfcj2H_Jw/viewform). After you fill in the form data, the sheet is updated automatically every 5 minutes

Any problems with the spreadsheet, please contact its maintener, *@theodoor5137*, on discord, or see the [Where can I get help? page](../GettingHelp/WhereCanIGetHelp.md).
